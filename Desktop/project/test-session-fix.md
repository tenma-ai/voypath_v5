# Session ID Fix Test

## Test Steps:

1. Clear localStorage to start fresh:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.clear()
   ```

2. Navigate to http://localhost:3003/trips/new

3. Create a new trip with:
   - Departure location: Tokyo Station
   - Name: Test Trip for Session Fix

4. Check console logs for session consistency

5. Navigate to My Trip page to verify trip appears

6. Navigate to My Places page and add a place

7. Check if places show up correctly

## Expected Behavior:
- Single consistent session ID across all pages
- Trip creation should work
- Trip should appear in My Trip page
- Places should be associated correctly

## Fixed Issues:
- Added comprehensive logging in main-layout.tsx
- Fixed user creation in trip-actions.ts to use session_id lookup
- Ensured consistent session ID usage
- Added better error handling and validation

## Key Changes:
1. Session creation now has better error handling and logging
2. Trip creation verifies user exists by session_id instead of user_id
3. Consistent use of actualUserId for database operations
4. Better logging throughout the flow
