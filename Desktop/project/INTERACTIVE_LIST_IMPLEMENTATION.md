- Time allocation suggestions
- Distance optimization recommendations
- User satisfaction improvement tips

### Advanced Interactions
- Drag and drop reordering with impact preview
- Inline time adjustment with live feedback
- Bulk operations for multiple destinations
- Progressive enhancement for different user capabilities

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Dependencies Added
```json
{
  "@dnd-kit/core": "^6.3.1",
  "@dnd-kit/sortable": "^10.0.0",
  "@dnd-kit/utilities": "^3.2.2"
}
```

### Drag and Drop Configuration
```typescript
const sensors = useSensors(
  useSensor(PointerSensor, {
    activationConstraint: {
      distance: 8,
      delay: 200
    }
  }),
  useSensor(TouchSensor, {
    activationConstraint: {
      delay: 250,
      tolerance: 8
    }
  })
)
```

### Mobile Optimizations
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px for all interactive elements
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear drag state indicators and drop zones
- **Performance**: Optimized for large lists with virtualization ready
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support

## üé® UI/UX Enhancements

### Visual Hierarchy
- Color-coded user preferences
- Clear visual distinction between excluded/included destinations
- Intuitive drag handles and drop zones
- Consistent iconography throughout

### Responsive Behavior
