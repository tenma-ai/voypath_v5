# Emergency Access Restoration - RLS Debug Mode

## üö® Current Status: DEBUGGING MODE ACTIVE

### Applied Emergency Fixes (2025-06-28)

Due to authentication errors after RLS implementation, the following temporary policies have been applied:

#### ‚úÖ Fixed Issues
1. **Removed duplicate policies** from trips table
2. **Added service role access** for Edge Functions
3. **Updated trips view policy** to include owners and members
4. **Added temporary broad access** for debugging

#### üîß Temporary Policies Added

```sql
-- Service role access for Edge Functions
CREATE POLICY "Service role can access all trips" ON trips FOR ALL
CREATE POLICY "Service role can access all places" ON places FOR ALL  
CREATE POLICY "Service role can access all trip members" ON trip_members FOR ALL
CREATE POLICY "Service role can access all users" ON users FOR ALL

-- Guest/anonymous access for development
CREATE POLICY "Guest users can view trips (temporary)" ON trips FOR SELECT
CREATE POLICY "Guest users can create trips (temporary)" ON trips FOR INSERT
CREATE POLICY "Guest users can view places (temporary)" ON places FOR SELECT
CREATE POLICY "Guest users can add places (temporary)" ON places FOR INSERT

-- Broad debugging access (REMOVE AFTER TESTING)
CREATE POLICY "Temporary broad access for debugging" ON trips FOR ALL
CREATE POLICY "Temporary broad access for places debugging" ON places FOR ALL
CREATE POLICY "Temporary broad access for trip_members debugging" ON trip_members FOR ALL
```

#### üéØ Next Steps

1. **Test application functionality** - Verify basic operations work
2. **Check authentication flow** - Ensure users can log in and access data
3. **Remove broad debugging policies** - Once authentication is confirmed working
4. **Gradually tighten security** - Restore proper RLS restrictions

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Notice

**CURRENT STATE**: Temporarily permissive for debugging
**PRODUCTION READY**: NO - requires security tightening
**DATA PROTECTION**: Basic RLS still active, but with broad access

#### üîÑ Rollback Commands

If further issues occur, use these emergency commands:

```sql
-- Complete RLS disable (EMERGENCY ONLY)
ALTER TABLE trips DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE places DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE trip_members DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE users DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Re-enable after fixing
ALTER TABLE trips ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE places ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE trip_members ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

#### üìã Error Resolution Log

**Original Errors**:
- 403 Forbidden on trips REST API
- 400/500 on Edge Functions (select-optimal-places, optimize-route, normalize-preferences)
- Authentication flow disruption

**Applied Fixes**:
- Service role policies for Edge Functions
- Temporary guest access policies
- Broad debugging policies for testing

**Status**: Ready for application testing
