# 📋 Voypath Route Optimization System - Comprehensive Implementation TODO

## 🎯 Current Implementation Status Analysis

### ✅ **COMPLETED (Database Foundation)**
- **Database Schema**: Excellently designed with all required tables
- **Basic Place Registration**: Users can add places with coordinates and wish levels
- **Member Colors Table**: 10-color palette ready (`member_colors` table)
- **Geographic Regions**: Japanese regions with airport/transport metadata
- **Optimization Tables**: `optimization_results`, `optimization_cache` prepared
- **Transport Constraints**: Regional transport rules defined

### ❌ **NOT IMPLEMENTED (Critical Systems)**
- **Member Color Assignment**: `assigned_color_index` is NULL for all users
- **Wish Level Normalization**: `normalized_wish_level` is NULL for all places
- **Place Selection System**: `is_selected_for_optimization` is FALSE for all places
- **AirportDB Integration**: `airportdb_cache` table missing entirely
- **TSP Optimization**: Only partial greedy implementation exists
- **Transport Mode Decision**: No AirportDB integration
- **Travel Time Calculation**: No realistic calculation system
- **Day Splitting**: No constraint-based splitting
- **Meal Break Insertion**: No automatic meal scheduling
- **Detailed Schedule Building**: No comprehensive scheduling system
- **Frontend UI Integration**: No color visualization or optimization results display

### 🎯 **IDEAL WORKFLOW (User's Requirements)**
1. **Frontend → Database**: Record trip_id, member_id, member_color, member's places ✅ (Partial)
2. **Database → Backend**: Retrieve all data ✅ (Ready)
3. **Normalization**: Normalize wish levels ❌ (Missing)
4. **Fair Selection**: Equal member representation in place combination ❌ (Missing)
5. **Route Order**: Fixed departure/destination, visit order only ❌ (Missing)
6. **Transport Decision**: Including AirportDB ❌ (Missing)
7. **Airport Insertion**: Insert airports at appropriate positions ❌ (Missing)
8. **TSP Greedy**: Generate straight-line based route ❌ (Missing)

13. **Detailed Schedule**: Complete day-by-day timeline ❌ (Missing)
14. **Database → Frontend**: Return via database ❌ (Missing)
15. **UI Display**: Member color logic + UI display ❌ (Missing)

### 🚨 **CRITICAL PROBLEMS**
1. **Data Flow Disconnection**: Each step operates in isolation
2. **Member Color System**: Completely non-functional despite good schema
3. **AirportDB Missing**: No airport detection capability prevents flight optimization
4. **Column Inconsistency**: display_color vs assigned_color_index confusion
5. **Optimization Algorithm**: Core TSP and constraint logic missing
